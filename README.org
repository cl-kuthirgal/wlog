#+TITLE: wlog

Voice logging for, mostly remote, work.

=wlogging= is what we are trying to use for voice tweeting at work. We keep a
listen server running in our office (and other places) and use clients (as of
now only for Emacs) for tweeting.

** Quickstart
We use in memory redis pub/sub for keeping audio so we need a redis running
somewhere.

*** Dash Server
The dash plays all the audios coming in on the server. This needs =play= installed
and a working speaker.

Run =make= to build the server (you will need [[https://github.com/roswell/roswell][roswell]] for this) and run
=./wlog-dash= to start. Relevant environment variables are:

1. =WLOG_REDIS_HOST=. Defaults to =127.0.0.1=
2. =WLOG_REDIS_PORT=. Defaults to =6379=.
3. =WLOG_REDIS_CHANNEL=. Defaults to =wlog-channel=.

*** Emacs Client
Just running =wlog= from the package =wlog.el= should work. This depends on =arecord=
and =sox= command line tools.
