#+TITLE: wlog

Voice logging for, mostly remote, work.

The steps are not polished enough so don't expect all to work right away.

=wlogging= is what we are trying to use for voice tweeting at work. We keep a
listen server running in our office and use clients (as of now only for Emacs)
for tweeting.

** Quickstart
We use in memory redis pub/sub for keeping audio so we need a redis running
somewhere. The dash itself (use =make=) runs on a server with =play= installed and a
speaker present.

*** Emacs Client
Just running =wlog= from the package =wlog.el= should work. You might need to
temporary eval [[https://github.com/lepisma/emacs-speech-input/blob/master/esi-record.el][esi-record]] too (which in turn relies on =arecord=).
